# GFN-FF

This repository contains a standalone implementation of
the GFN-FF method (<https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202004239>).

The default CMake and meson builds compile a statically linked library (`libgfnff.a`) that can be linked in other projects.

`main.f90` in `testprog/` demonstrates the in-code usage.
